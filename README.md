  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

  My project is a CMS-style tech blog site that allows developers or tech writers to publish articles, blog posts, and their thoughts and opinions. 

  I created this project to connect tech writers and give them a platform to allow them to discuss anything and everything tech!

  A user can visit the website and see all of the blog posts with comments. If a user would like to post or comment as well, they will need to either sign up or log in. Once they log into the site, they will be able to go to their dashboard and add new posts, view single posts and add comments, and edit any blog posts they posted. 

  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)

  No installation required.
